#Inital: Both Control Reward and Lasso Reward start with a set amount of dollar

#Goals: What happens if we bought the stock and just held on to it? (Control Reward)

#Goals: How do we make use of the lasso file to tell us when to buy and sell? (Lasso Reward)
# reward = difference between actual values -- choices are only influenced by predicted values however
# we want to buy at either the beginning or end of the week (what if we buy at start of week and sell at end of week??? - think about using data in smart ways to make cool algoriths) -- open 1Data folder and use datetime to get the specific open
# possible alg for paper trading:
# take mean error for our prediction (ex: open average) -- if mean error is 50 cents, and our prediction is above a 50 cent increase, then buy, else don't -- need to "wait" 10 week_bin_list
# if mean error > predicted increase, then don't buy

# also maybe consider volatility
